# PasswordChecker
## Introduction
Project realized during my international exchange program at Ahlia University. The goal was to write a computer program that implements/simulates specific mutual trust (password validation).  
This program checks:  
-	If the password is the same as the username.
-	If the password contains at least 10 characters.
-	If the password contains digits.
-	If the password contains uppercase characters.
-	If the password contains lowercase characters.
-	If the password contains special characters.
Then it tries to bruteforce it and dictionnary attack it with the passwords file passed in parameters.

## Usage
`py PasswordChecker.py passwordsFile` Execute the program with the given passwords file.
